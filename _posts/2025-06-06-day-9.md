what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned important concepts related to Pandas DataFrames in Python. I explored how to use functions like 'shape' to understand the dimensions of a DataFrame, and 'head()' and 'tail' to preview the first and last few rows of data. I also learned how to access column names and analyze basic statistics such as the maximum, minimum, and standard deviation values using built-in functions. Additionally, the 'describe()' function was introduced, which provides a summary of key statistical measures for numerical columns. We also discussed a project overview, giving context to how these DataFrame tools can be applied in real data analysis scenarios.

reflection: |
  Reflecting on today's learning, I feel more confident in working with Pandas DataFrames and analyzing data effectively. Understanding how to use functions like 'shape', 'head()', and 'tail()' helps me quickly assess the structure and contents of a dataset. Learning to find the maximum, minimum, and standard deviation values has shown me how to gain insights into the data's distribution and range. The 'describe()' function stood out as a powerful tool for summarizing numerical data with just one line of code. Discussing the project overview helped me see the practical applications of these techniques and how they fit into a larger data analysis workflow. Overall, this session gave me a solid foundation to build on for future projects.
