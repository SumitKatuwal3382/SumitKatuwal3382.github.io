what_i_learned: |
  Today we started our day with python learning. We learned lot about text file and used it on some labs too. Then we learned about Generative AI and LLMs such as What they are?, where they are use?, etc. We played some quick kahoot and decided some picture that were bot or real. Although the pictures were not that tough but i learned that day that AI can generate those kind of picture which would have been our expectations back in the day.

 No blockers!

reflection: |
  We practice good amount of coding and worked on some labs. We learned about generative AI models and knew what LLMs are. We played kahoot and ended our day with real or bot pictures and with that the owl picture was disturbing because i couldn't guess that correctly. It looked like a human clicked picture but it was actually AI generated.
