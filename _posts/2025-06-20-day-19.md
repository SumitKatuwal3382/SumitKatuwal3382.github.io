what_i_learned: |
 Today, I learned how to use the Football API to fetch fixture and statistics data for specific teams, enhancing my skills in API integration. I gained experience in handling JSON responses and parsing them to extract relevant information like match dates, team stats, and events. I also learned to manage errors and exceptions in API calls, ensuring the code handles issues gracefully when data is unavailable or malformed. Working with the datetime module helped me understand how to format and display date information from API responses effectively. Additionally, I practiced debugging code, identifying a typo in the main function where seaon should be season, which improved my attention to detail in programming.

reflection: |
 Reflecting on today, I feel proud of tackling the Football API integration, as it pushed me to apply my coding skills in a real-world context. The process of debugging the typo in the main function taught me the importance of thorough code review, which I’ll prioritize more in future projects. I enjoyed learning how to handle API errors, as it gave me confidence in building robust applications that can adapt to unexpected issues. Working with date formatting and JSON parsing was challenging but rewarding, showing me the value of breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps. This experience motivates me to explore more API-based projects to further enhance my programming expertise.
