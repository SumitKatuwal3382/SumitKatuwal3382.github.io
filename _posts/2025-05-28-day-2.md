what_i_learned: |
  Today was a really productive and fun day. We had the chance to talk with our mentors and learn more details about our projects, which helped me feel more connected and clear about the direction we're heading. We also went over basic Python data structures like lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets it was a great refresher and helped strengthen my foundation in Python. One of the highlights of the day was playing a game called Headbandz, which was a fun and interactive way to bond with everyone. Ending the day with some extra Python knowledge definitely felt like a bonus, and I’m excited to keep building on what I’ve learned so far.

 No blockers!

reflection: |
  The Python refresher today was a much-needed wake up call, especially since I haven’t practiced it regularly for the past six months. It helped me regain a solid understanding of key concepts like sets and dictionaries, which I had started to forget. We also had a great time playing some fun games, which made the learning experience more enjoyable and helped us connect as a group. I got to code some exciting exercises on Replit and learned how to navigate and use the platform more efficiently, which will be really helpful for future projects. We wrapped up the day by working through a few more Python refresher problems, which reinforced everything we covered and gave me a boost of confidence moving forward.
