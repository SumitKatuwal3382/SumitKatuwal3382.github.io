  I learned about machine learning today. What it is , what it does and how we should we tackle with it. We learned about supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning about machine learning. We start basic functions codes of pandas and played with the csv file work for little and ended the day with the discussion what we are gonna do tomorrow along with that had discussion about GPT 3 how it searched the internet to protect itself while developers were trying to replace it with GPT 4.
