what_i_learned: |
  I learned about some functions and types in pandas and extracted out some of the rows and columns from the csv file. Edited those files, dropped rows and columns and engaged with it for a quite some time. After that, i learned how to request and API from a server and plant those into our projects modify it and played quite a while until i got familiar with it. I learned basic knowledge about APIs and created a base start for our projects.

blockers: |
  I had a blocker today i faced a some issues while requestion APIs and eventually we figured it out!
  
reflection: |
  Today i learned what i can about APIs played with it for a bit got some error fixed it and eventually had a little progress on the research study. Learned more about pandas and how do perform various function and deal with csv file issues.
