what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about some key Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools available in the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. I explored the WordNetLemmatizer, which helps in reducing words to their base or dictionary form, known as lemmatization. I practiced writing a small script that lemmatizes each word in a sentence using the verb part-of-speech. I also learned about the SnowballStemmer, which is used for stemming words and supports multiple languages such as French, German, Spanish, and more. It was interesting to see how stemming and lemmatization differ, and how each can be useful in preparing text data for NLP tasks.

reflection: |
  Today’s session gave me a deeper appreciation for how powerful and useful NLP tools like NLTK can be. I found it really exciting to see how lemmatization and stemming work behind the scenes to simplify and clean up text data. Writing actual code to test the WordNetLemmatizer and SnowballStemmer helped me connect theory with practice, which made the learning process more engaging. It was also interesting to discover that SnowballStemmer supports multiple languages, which opens up a lot of possibilities for working with international datasets. Overall, this experience boosted my confidence in using Python for text processing, and it motivated me to explore more advanced NLP techniques in the future.
