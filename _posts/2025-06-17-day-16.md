what_i_learned: |
 Today, I learned how to adapt Python’s http.client.HTTPSConnection for use in Google Colab to securely connect to the Football API (v3.football.api-sports.io) and retrieve match statistics, enhancing my skills in real-time data handling. I gained practical experience in dynamically determining a team’s primary league using the Counter class within Colab, which streamlined the input process by eliminating the need for a league ID. I explored fetching and displaying detailed statistics like shots on goal, yellow cards, and possession for both teams in a match using the /fixtures/statistics endpoint, all seamlessly integrated into the Colab environment. Additionally, I understood the importance of managing API rate limits with time.sleep(1) in Colab to ensure consistent data retrieval, a critical aspect for project reliability. This hands-on experience has significantly boosted my confidence in processing sports data and preparing it for further analysis or visualization within Colab! I also worked on little bit of literature review part for our research paper.


blockers: |
  One blocker I faced today was the initial difficulty in integrating Python’s http.client.HTTPSConnection with Google Colab due to unfamiliarity with Colab’s environment, which slowed my progress in retrieving match statistics from the Football API. Another challenge was ensuring the time.sleep(1) function effectively managed API rate limits, as I had to troubleshoot unexpected delays and incomplete data retrievals to maintain project reliability.
  
reflection: |
 Today, reflecting on my work, I found adapting Python’s http.client.HTTPSConnection for Google Colab to connect securely with the Football API (v3.football.api-sports.io) and retrieve match statistics to be a rewarding challenge that sharpened my real-time data handling skills. I enjoyed the process of dynamically determining a team’s primary league with the Counter class in Colab, which not only simplified the input process by removing the league ID requirement but also made me appreciate the power of automated data preprocessing. Exploring the /fixtures/statistics endpoint to display detailed stats like shots on goal and yellow cards for both teams within Colab’s environment was exciting, as it brought the data to life in a practical way. Managing API rate limits with time.sleep(1) taught me the importance of maintaining reliability in data retrieval, a lesson I’ll carry forward in ensuring robust project execution. Additionally, dipping into the literature review for our research paper gave me a sense of accomplishment, connecting my technical efforts to the broader context of sports informatics, and I’m eager to build on this foundation as the project progresses!
