what_i_learned: |
  We started our day with some school enrichment. We walked in the campus watched new buildings and spent time with our friends and other groups. After that we learned abour APIs requests more. How we can take data from one url and perform task on the project with those Urls. I learned about literature review for the final paper and ended the day with some discussion on further things that we can add on our project.

reflection: |
  Today was a well-rounded and engaging day of learning. We began with a school enrichment activity that allowed us to walk around campus, observe the new buildings, and spend time interacting with our friends and other groups. It was a great opportunity to connect with our surroundings and with each other in a relaxed setting. Later, we shifted our focus to a more technical topic: API requests. I learned how we can retrieve data from a URL and use that information in our projects. Understanding how APIs work and how to integrate them into a project is a valuable skill, and I feel more confident in using them to enhance our work.
