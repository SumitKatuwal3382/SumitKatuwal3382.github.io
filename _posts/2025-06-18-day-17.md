 Today, I learned about the dynamics of team-building through an ice breaker session with a high school teacher, which helped me understand her background and teaching style. During the session, I introduced myself, sharing my interests and goals, which fostered a sense of connection and collaboration. We recapped our ongoing project, clarifying objectives and aligning on tasks for the upcoming week. The discussion on AI in modern surgery was particularly enlightening, as I learned how AI tools assist surgeons with precision, diagnostics, and real-time decision-making. Overall, the day emphasized the importance of communication, planning, and the transformative role of technology in healthcare.
