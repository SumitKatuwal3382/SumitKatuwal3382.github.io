what_i_learned: |
 Today, I learned how to interact with APIs to fetch and analyze data, specifically focusing on handling football statistics through services like API-Football, which enhanced my understanding of real-time data retrieval for sports analytics. I explored techniques for managing API responses, including error checking and navigating nested JSON structures, to organize data into structured formats like Pandas DataFrames. I also participated in a quiz on APIs and data handling, which reinforced my knowledge of key concepts and practical applications in this area. Additionally, I engaged in planning for next week’s activities, setting clear goals for further exploration of data-driven projects. These experiences deepened my appreciation for how APIs can streamline data collection and support analytical tasks in various domains.
