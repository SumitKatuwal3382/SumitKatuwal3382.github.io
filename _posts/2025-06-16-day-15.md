what_i_learned: |
 Today, I learned how to use Python’s `http.client.HTTPSConnection` to establish a secure connection to the Football API server at `v3.football.api-sports.io` for fetching team statistics. I gained insight into modifying code to dynamically determine a team’s primary league by analyzing fixture data, eliminating the need to manually input a league ID. I also understood how to aggregate and display stats like shots on goal, yellow cards, and red cards across all fixtures for a given team and season using the `/fixtures/statistics` endpoint. Additionally, I discovered the importance of handling API rate limits with `time.sleep(1)` to ensure reliable data retrieval. Overall, I’m excited about how these skills can help me process football data more efficiently for my project!

 Today, I deepened my understanding of using Python’s `http.client.HTTPSConnection` to connect securely to the Football API, which felt like a big step in mastering low-level HTTP requests. Figuring out how to dynamically identify a team’s primary league from fixture data was challenging but rewarding, as it streamlined the code by removing the need for a league ID input. I’m excited about how the code now aggregates shots on goal, yellow cards, and red cards across a season, giving me a clearer picture of team performance. Learning to manage API rate limits with `time.sleep(1)` was a practical lesson in handling real-world API constraints. Overall, I feel more confident in processing and analyzing football data, and I’m eager to apply these skills to enhance my project further!
