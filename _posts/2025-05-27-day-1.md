what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned in depth about what GitHub is and how it differs from Git. I now understand that Git is a version control system that helps track changes in code, while GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and allows for collaboration with others. I also explored the different things we can do with Git and GitHub, like branching, merging, and managing projects more efficiently. In the middle of the day, we had a fun break where all the participants played a unique version of bingo, which was a completely new experience for me. We also took a Python placement test, which helped me reflect on what I already know and what I still need to work on—it was a fun and productive day overall!

reflection: |
It was great learning about all the things GitHub can do—I had no idea it offered so many useful tools for collaboration and version control. I used to think it would be really complicated to learn on my own, but with the right guidance, it turned out to be pretty straightforward. I now understand the difference between Git and GitHub, and how they work together to manage and share code more efficiently. The new bingo game we played was really cool too—it was a fun way to connect with others and made the day feel more interactive. Overall, I walked away with a solid understanding of GitHub basics and a better appreciation for how useful it is in real-world coding projects.
