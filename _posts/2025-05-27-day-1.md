what_i_learned: |
  I learned deep about what Github was. And i also learn the difference between Git and Github and along with that i learned what types of thing we can do using those. At the middle part aof the day we played bingo with all of the participants and took a python placement test. It was very fun to play that bingo and it was a new type of bingo that i got introduced to.

blockers: |
  No blockers!

reflection: |
  It was great when i came to know about things that github can do. I thought it would have been much complicated if i learned it by myself, but it's actually pretty straightforward!. the new bingo game was really cool because it helped me engage with my peers.
