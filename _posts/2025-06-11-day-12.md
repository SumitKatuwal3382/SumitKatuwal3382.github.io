what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to interact with a football API using Python's requests library to fetch team fixtures based on team ID and season. I explored how to handle API responses, including checking for errors and handling missing or nested data safely using .get(). I practiced organizing the fetched data into a readable format by creating a structured list of dictionaries, which was then converted into a Pandas DataFrame. I also understood how to determine the match winner by evaluating Boolean flags in the API's team data. Lastly, I learned how to prompt user input, validate it, and use it dynamically to query real-time football data.

reflection: |
  Today’s coding exercise deepened my understanding of working with external APIs and real-world data. By integrating the API-Football service, I practiced sending requests, managing authentication, and parsing complex JSON responses. I realized the importance of writing defensive code—especially when dealing with nested data structures that might be incomplete or inconsistent. Turning raw data into a meaningful and clean Pandas DataFrame gave me insight into how data can be organized and presented for analysis. Overall, this task improved both my technical skills and my confidence in handling real-time data pipelines using Python.
