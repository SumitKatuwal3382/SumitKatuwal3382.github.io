what_i_learned: |
  Today we started our day with some computer vision workshop and learned new things and knew about YOLO. We learned how actually the computer vision works. And we played some breakout challenging game. Then we ended our day with some python code and some new things bout disctionaries and writing some codes related to it.

 No blockers!

reflection: |
  I played a memorable new game and struggled on it little bit. Learned about computer vision and implemented it. Learned more about reading, appending, writing files on python. Python 102 session was interesting and participation on Q and A sessions was very good because i learned a lot from it.
