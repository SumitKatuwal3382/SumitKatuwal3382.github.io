  Today we started our day with some computer vision workshop and learned new things and knew about YOLO. We learned how actually the computer vision works. Then we played some breakout challenging game. Then we ended our day with some python code.

 No blockers!

reflection: |
  I played a memorable new game and struggled on it little bit. Learned about computer vision and implemented it. Learned more about reading, appending, writing files.
