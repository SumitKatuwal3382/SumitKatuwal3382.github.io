what_i_learned: |
  I learned what AI is today at the orientation bootcamp and met our group members. We met at our office location and discussed our roles and resposibility. Our conversation went very fluent without any obstacles and everyone participated and talked frankly. 

blockers: |
  No Blockers!
  
reflection: |
  Today the way i talked was very satisfying since i came in this country i always hesitated talking frankly. Our mentor was great enough to let us talk ourselves and put our this at the table. Dependent and independent variable was also great this i learned.
