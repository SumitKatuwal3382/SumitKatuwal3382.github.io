what_i_learned: |
  Today at the orientation bootcamp, I was introduced to the basics of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which gave me a clearer understanding of what AI is and how it impacts various aspects of our lives. We also had the chance to meet our group members in person at our designated office location, which was a great opportunity to start building team connections. During our meeting, we discussed our individual roles and responsibilities within the group, and it was encouraging to see that everyone was open, engaged, and communicating clearly. The conversation flowed naturally without any awkward moments, and each member shared their thoughts confidently. Toward the end of the day, we had an insightful discussion on the topic of how AI might replace certain jobs in the future, which led to some thought-provoking points and different perspectives. We wrapped up by reflecting on both the potential risks and benefits of AI, leaving us with a lot to think about as we move forward in the program.

reflection: |
   Today, I felt really satisfied with how I spoke because ever since I came to this country, I’ve often hesitated to speak openly and confidently. Our mentor created a welcoming environment that encouraged us to express ourselves freely and share our ideas without fear. I also learned about dependent and independent variables, which was a valuable and clear topic that helped me understand how experiments and data analysis work. The discussion on "How AI will take many jobs in the future" was by far the most interesting conversation I’ve had so far—it really made me think about the future of work and technology. Overall, today was a great experience both in terms of improving my communication skills and expanding my knowledge. I’m looking forward to more sessions like this where I can learn and grow even more.
