project_title: "FIFA Club World Cup 2025: Developing Post-game content using AI for automated box scores and video news reports"

problem: |
  Without AI-driven post-game content generation, fans and media outlets face slow and inconsistent coverage. Match summaries, box scores, and highlight videos often take hours to produce manually, delaying fan engagement and reducing traffic during peak moments. Smaller teams and international audiences are frequently underserved, receiving limited or no localized content. Journalists are burdened with repetitive tasks, leaving less time for in-depth analysis. Meanwhile, video production remains costly and inaccessible for many platforms. This creates a gap in timely, scalable, and engaging post-match content—especially during global events like the FIFA Club World Cup.


approach: |
  The project follows 10 week ket activities:

  - Virtual Bootcamp
  - Introduction to Machine and Deep learning models
  - Project Setup and Data Familarization
  - Real-Time Data pipeline and system integration (part 1)
  - Mid Summer Presentation
  - Text-to-speech / Audio synthesis integration
  - System Integration (part 2) and intermediate Demo
  - Model Optimization
  - Literature Review
  - Mandatory End of summer reasearch symposium

  Knowledge of python, pytorch, tensorflow, github, pandas, numpy is very essential in this project.

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, we will finsished developing automated, real-time generation of post-game box scores, match summaries, and video news reports—delivering fast, consistent, and engaging content for global audiences during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025.
