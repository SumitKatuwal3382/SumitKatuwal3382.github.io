  bio: |
    I‚Äôm currently a Senior studying Computer Science at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Mayland. I expect to graduate in 2026.

    My work explores the intersection of hardware and intelligence‚Äîhow wearable devices and embedded systems can help people better understand their health and environment.

    When I‚Äôm not working on research, I enjoy playing soccer, hanging out with friends, travelling new places doing new projects.
